# AwesomeCookieClicker

Overall, I really enjoy making the game! I was able to mostly put in practice new concepts learned this week but also work on some old ones. From 'Grid', to 'fetchData' or 'boolean', loops on arrays that consist of objects, local storage, addEventListener, etc. This project made me dive into these concepts a bit more. JavaScript is such a powerful tool!

Lowlights: The code that addresses the logic behind the cookies count needs to be improved. The first main challenge I faced was to be able to create an event for some information of the objects of the array. I finally managed to do so with some input from the trainers but therefore wasted quite a lot of time there. Besides that I still need to work to better understand local storage.
There are few things I would like to improve:

- establish a local storage for rate
- I wanted to add a line to says name/ cost/ upgrade. I tried to do the following 'upgrades.unshift({name: "Name", cost: "Cost", increase: "Inceease}) but couldn't get this to work.
- I wanted to have a box that displays messages about the upgrades every 3 minutes (setInterval) and add their images
- Make the cookie more central and more importantly toggle after a click
- I need more functions!! The function Deals does a lot and the variable 'counter' is used everywhere and there is therefore quite a lot of "strain" to it.

Highlights: Implementing the latest concepts learned was definitely one of the main highlights of this project. fetchData, .json(), setTimeout, etc.
I was quite satisfied with the fact that I was to run through array, setting up eventlistener. I definitely get into a rythm about linking about element with DOM, defining it and the transferring it. Overall, I see how things learned in the first two weeks come in together with JavaScript to create insightful webpages. I was nice to see how setting time out can be useful.
I also enjoyed learning new concepts through the projects such as making the cooking spin through keyframe and rotate linear.
